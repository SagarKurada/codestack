1. Rechanging/Updating the columns: 
   Using UPDATE and CASE...WHEN
  a)update salary
    set sex=
    case
    when sex='m' then 'f'
    when sex='f' then 'm'
    end; 
  b)update salary 
    set sex = 
    IF (sex = "m", "f", "m");
    
2. Reformat Department Table : Rows to Columns : Pivot 
  select id,
    sum(IF(month = 'Jan', revenue, NULL)) as Jan_Revenue,
    sum(IF(month = 'Feb', revenue, NULL)) as Feb_Revenue,
    sum(IF(month = 'Mar', revenue, NULL)) as Mar_Revenue,
    sum(IF(month = 'Apr', revenue, NULL)) as Apr_Revenue,
    sum(IF(month = 'May', revenue, NULL)) as May_Revenue,
    sum(IF(month = 'Jun', revenue, NULL)) as Jun_Revenue,
    sum(IF(month = 'Jul', revenue, NULL)) as Jul_Revenue,
    sum(IF(month = 'Aug', revenue, NULL)) as Aug_Revenue,
    sum(IF(month = 'Sep', revenue, NULL)) as Sep_Revenue,
    sum(IF(month = 'Oct', revenue, NULL)) as Oct_Revenue,
    sum(IF(month = 'Nov', revenue, NULL)) as Nov_Revenue,
    sum(IF(month = 'Dec', revenue, NULL)) as Dec_Revenue
